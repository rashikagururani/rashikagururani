'''
we are going to determine how long it will take you to save enough money to make the down payment given the following assumptions:
1.Call the cost of your dream home total_cost .

2.Call the portion of the cost needed for a down payment portion_down_payment . For simplicity, assume that portion_down_payment = 0.25 (25%).

3.Call the amount that you have saved thus far current_savings . You start with a current savings of $0.

4.Assume that you invest your current savings wisely, with an annual return of r (in other words, at the end of each month, you receive an additional current_savings*r/12 funds to put into your savings â€“ the 12 is because r is an annual rate). Assume that your investments earn a return of r = 0.04 (4%).

5.Assume your annual salary is annual_salary .

6.Assume you are going to dedicate a certain amount of your salary each month to saving for the down payment. Call that portion_saved . This variable should be in decimal form (i.e. 0.1 for 10%).

7.At the end of each month, your savings will be increased by the return on your investment, plus a percentage of your monthly salary (annual salary / 12).
